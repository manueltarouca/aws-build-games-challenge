## Installation

1. Install Python 3.7 or higher
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Game

### Option 1: Full Experience (with Highscores)

```bash
python start_game.py
```

This starts both the highscore service and the game.

### Option 2: Game Only

```bash
python main.py
```

This runs just the game without highscore functionality.

### Option 3: Service Only

```bash
python highscore_service.py
```

This runs just the highscore web service on port 5000.

## Game Elements

- **Gray Hexagons**: Floor tiles (walkable)
- **Dark Gray Hexagons**: Walls (impassable)
- **Blue Hexagons**: Stairs down to next floor
- **Gold Hexagons**: Gold to collect
- **Red Hexagons**: Enemies (fight automatically when stepped on)
- **Purple Circle**: Your player character

## Enemy Types

- **Goblins** (Red): Weak but common enemies (20 HP, 8 ATK, 2 DEF)
- **Skeletons** (Gray): Fast but fragile (15 HP, 10 ATK, 1 DEF)
- **Orcs** (Dark Red): Balanced fighters (35 HP, 12 ATK, 4 DEF)
- **Trolls** (Brown): Powerful late-game enemies (60 HP, 18 ATK, 8 DEF)

## Enemy Behavior

- **Wandering**: Enemies move randomly when not aware of the player
- **Detection**: Each enemy type has different vision ranges
- **Chasing**: Enemies will pursue the player when detected
- **Different Speeds**: Each enemy type moves at different intervals
  - Skeletons: Fast (1.5s between moves)
  - Goblins: Medium (2.5s between moves)
  - Orcs: Slow (3.0s between moves)
  - Trolls: Very slow (4.0s between moves)

## Procedural Generation

The game uses a **Nuclear Throne-inspired** generation system:

- **Random Walkers**: "FloorMakers" carve out organic dungeon layouts
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Walkers can turn, split, carve rooms, and die based on probabilities
- **Area Types**: Different floor types (Dungeon, Corridors, Caverns) with unique characteristics
- **Organic Layouts**: No rigid room-and-corridor system - naturally flowing spaces
- **Progressive Complexity**: Deeper floors use different generation parameters

### Generation Process:

1. **Floor Carving**: Walkers move through the grid, converting walls to floors
2. **Room Creation**: Walkers occasionally carve out larger open areas
3. **Corridor Splitting**: New walkers spawn to create branching paths
4. **Smart Termination**: Process ends when target floor count is reached
5. **Item Placement**: Stairs placed far from start, gold scattered throughout

## Highscore System

The game features a comprehensive highscore system with web service backend:

- **Flexible Submission**: Scores are preserved and submitted when username is available
- **Username Tracking**: Enter your username to track personal progress (or play as "Anonymous")
- **Retroactive Submission**: Set username after playing to submit previous scores
- **Leaderboards**: View top 10 players and your personal rank
- **Statistics**: Track score, floor reached, gold collected, and enemies defeated
- **Local Service**: Runs locally but designed for easy deployment
- **Offline Mode**: Game works without highscore service
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear submission status indicators

### Highscore Flow:

1. **Play Game** ‚Üí Score is always preserved
2. **Enter Username** (optional) ‚Üí Automatic submission
3. **Anonymous Play** ‚Üí Scores submitted as "Anonymous"
4. **Retroactive Submission** ‚Üí Username can be set after playing

### Highscore Calculation:

- **Primary Score**: Gold collected
- **Secondary**: Floor reached (for tie-breaking)
- **Additional Stats**: Enemies defeated, total gold

## Gameplay Tips

- Collect gold to increase your score
- Avoid enemies when possible, as they deal damage
- Your health increases when you go to the next floor
- Higher floors have more enemies but also more gold
- Plan your route carefully in the hexagonal grid
